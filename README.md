# Description

This color theme is in honor and inspired by Jonathan Blow's EMACS UI he regularly uses. This is not a direct port but I tried to get as close as possible.

PLEASE NOTE: this is _NOT_ a complete syntax highlighter, this is a UI color theme. Although priority is set on foreground and background colors of text to replicate his theme, it does not take into account every single languages patterns.

If a color isn't right, or you would like to recommend an alteration to an existing one, or you would like to suggest a new color for a particular circumstance let me know on the github repo found [here](https://github.com/soulshined/Visual-Studio-Code-Naysayer88-Color-Theme/issues)

# Getting Started Recommendation

In order to get the real feel of how Jonathan Blow uses his editor, I recommend these following `User Settings` KVP's to completely immerse yourself in the experience:

```json
  {
    ...
    "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
    ...
  }
```

I have added these configurations to the most commonly used languages for you, but the chance you don't use a common langauge I recommend those settings to get the true representation of his EMACS theme.
